# PHP Code Quality Improvements Summary

## Task Completed Successfully

### 1. Added ninjify/qa as Development Dependency
- Added `ninjify/qa: *` to the `require-dev` section of `composer.json`
- Successfully installed the package along with its dependencies:
  - `php-parallel-lint/php-parallel-lint` (v1.4.0)
  - `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` (3.13.2)
  - `slevomat/coding-standard` (7.2.1)
  - `ninjify/coding-standard` (v0.12.1)
  - Other supporting packages

### 2. Linting Analysis Performed
- **PHP Syntax Check**: No syntax errors found in source code
- **Code Standards Check**: Found 8 PSR12 violations across 2 files

### 3. Code Quality Issues Fixed
Applied PSR12 coding standard fixes to both source files:

#### `src/Utils/Arrays.php` (4 fixes):
- Added blank line after opening PHP tag
- Removed blank line after class opening brace
- Added newline at end of file
- Fixed class closing brace placement

#### `src/Utils/Colors.php` (4 fixes):
- Added blank line after opening PHP tag
- Changed `TRUE` to `true` (lowercase boolean)
- Removed blank line at end of control structure
- Added newline at end of file

### 4. Business Logic Verification
- **All tests pass**: 2 tests executed successfully (0.0 seconds)
- **No functionality changes**: Only coding style improvements were made
- **No breaking changes**: Business logic remains completely intact

### 5. Final Quality Check
- **Zero linting errors**: All PSR12 coding standard violations resolved
- **Clean syntax**: No PHP syntax errors
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Used professional quality assurance tools

## Tools Used
- `ninjify/qa` package for comprehensive code quality analysis
- `php-parallel-lint` for syntax checking
- `phpcs` (PHP CodeSniffer) for detecting coding standard violations
- `phpcbf` (PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer) for automatic fixes
- `nette/tester` for running unit tests

## Result
The aprila/utils project now adheres to PSR12 coding standards while maintaining full functionality and test coverage.
